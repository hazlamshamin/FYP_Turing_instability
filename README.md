# FYP_Turing_instability
This folder contains supplementary code from the research project that I completed during my final year undergraduate study at Imperial College London.
Only chunks of codes for the whole simulation are included. All files are function files with extension .m which can be run in Matlab.

The gen_matrix_F function generates a random matrix that represent a random reaction-diffusion system based on the random matrix matrix approach. 
The analyse_stability_F function analyses the linear stability of a random reaction-diffusion system in the absence and presence of diffusion, 
identify if Turing instability arise in the particular system then differentiate type of Turing instability if the previous is true.
